# Certificate-Generation

This is a certificate generation program for Texas A&M University. The software inserts learner information from an Excel spreadsheet into a certificate template, converts the template into a PDF, password-protects the PDF, and sends an email to the corresponding county representative and learner through VBA and Python.
